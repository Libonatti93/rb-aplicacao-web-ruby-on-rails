Complete web application with Ruby on Rails - a blogging application with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) features for posts.
It is important to follow some basic steps:
Keep in mind that to run it, you'll need to have Ruby, Rails, and a database (like SQLite, which is the default) configured in your environment.


Step by Step to Create the Application:
Install Rails: If you don't already have Rails installed, you can install it with:
gem install rails

Create a new Rails project:
rails new blog_app
cd blog_app

Generate the Model, Controller and Views for the Post: Let's create a Post resource with title and body attributes.
rails generate scaffold Post title:string body:text

Migrate the Database: After generating the scaffold, migrate the database to create the necessary tables.
rails db:migrate

Run the Server: Now, you can run the Rails server to see your application in action.
rails server

Go to http://localhost:3000/posts to see your blog application in action.
